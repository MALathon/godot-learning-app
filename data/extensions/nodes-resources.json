      "explanation": "This example shows the key difference between Nodes and Resources in Godot:\n\n**Resources (GameState):**\n- Store data and state\n- Can be easily saved/loaded to disk\n- Don't appear in the scene tree\n- Focused on data structure and logic\n- Lightweight and serializable\n\n**Nodes (GameManager, TicTacToeBoard):**\n- Handle behavior and scene management\n- Live in the scene tree\n- Process input, rendering, and updates\n- Manage other nodes and resources\n- Handle the game loop and user interaction\n\nThink of resources as \"what the game knows\" (data) and nodes as \"what the game does\" (behavior). This separation makes your code more organized and enables powerful features like save/load systems.",
