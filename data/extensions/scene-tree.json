      "explanation": "This shows how scene trees work in practice for a tic-tac-toe game. The board is the parent node that manages overall game state, while individual cells are child nodes that handle their own input and display. Parent-child relationships enable transform inheritance (cell positions are relative to board), organized structure, and clear communication patterns via signals. Each cell only knows about itself, while the parent coordinates the overall game.",
