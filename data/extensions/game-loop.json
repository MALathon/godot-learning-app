      "explanation": "This demonstrates the core game loop concept of delta time. The `_process(delta)` function is called every frame, and delta represents the time elapsed since the last frame. By multiplying movement by delta, we ensure consistent speed regardless of framerate - crucial for fair gameplay. Without delta, the object would move faster on high-FPS systems and slower on low-FPS systems.",
