      "content": "Great question! This is fundamental to understanding why GDScript performs the way it does.\n\n**Native Code** is machine code that runs directly on your CPU:\n- Compiled directly to CPU instructions (x86, ARM, etc.)\n- No interpreter needed - the CPU executes it directly\n- Maximum performance, but platform-specific\n- Languages like C++, Rust, Go produce native code\n\n**Bytecode** is an intermediate representation that needs a virtual machine (VM):\n- Compiled to instructions for a virtual CPU, not your real CPU\n- Needs an interpreter/VM to translate bytecode → native instructions\n- Platform independent, but adds overhead\n- Languages like Java, Python, and GDScript use bytecode**Why GDScript uses bytecode:**\n\n1. **Faster iteration** - No lengthy C++ compilation, just quick bytecode generation\n2. **Hot reloading** - Change code and see results instantly in the editor\n3. **Cross-platform** - Same bytecode runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, mobile\n4. **Safety** - VM can catch errors that would crash native code\n\nThe key insight: GDScript is designed for **game logic**, not heavy computation. When you need performance, you use Godot's built-in methods (written in C++) or write a GDExtension in C++.\n\nIn your tic-tac-toe game, the bytecode overhead is negligible because you're mostly calling Godot's UI methods and doing simple game state checks. The performance bottleneck would be rendering, physics, or audio - all handled by native C++ code.\n\nThis is why fighting GDScript's design by implementing complex algorithms in pure GDScript is usually the wrong approach. Instead, lean on Godot's built-in functionality!",
